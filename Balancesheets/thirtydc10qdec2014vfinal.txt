NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
--------------------------------------------------

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted   accounting
principles  ("GAAP")  and  with  instructions  to  Form-10Q  and  Article  10 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information required by
GAAP for a complete set of financial  statements.  In the opinion of management,
all adjustments,  (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for
a fair  presentation have been included in the financial  statements.  Operating
results for the interim  period are not  necessarily  indicative  of the results
that may be  expected  for the  fiscal  year  ended  June 30,  2015 or any other
period.  In addition,  the balance  sheet data at June 30, 2014 was derived from
the audited financial  statements but does not include all disclosures  required
by GAAP. This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Audited Financial
Statements  for the year ended June 30, 2014  included in the  Company's  annual
report on Form 10-K which was filed on October 10, 2014.

The unaudited condensed  consolidated  financial statements include the accounts
of 30DC,  Inc.,  (f/k/a Infinity  Capital Group,  Inc.) and its subsidiary 30DC,
Inc., Delaware, ("30DC DE").

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company offers  customers the option to purchase its digital  products for a
single payment or for a higher price consisting of a down payment and additional
payments over a period of time which can be as long as one year. Pursuant to ASC
605 the Company has  determined  that  revenue is  realizable  and the  earnings
process is complete and the four criteria for revenue  recognition stated in SAB
Topic 13 are met at the time of the initial purchase.  Accordingly,  the Company
deems the sale to have occurred at the time of initial  purchase and records the
full amount paid and/or due from a customer as revenue.  Typically customers are
offered a period to review the  product  and request a refund and if a refund is
requested the company reverses the revenue which was recorded at the time of the
sale. The Company  records a liability for future refunds and reduces revenue by
that amount. If a customer defaults on an additional payment, the customer loses
access to the digital  product.  Based upon its past  experience  with  extended
payment plans, the Company has estimated the number of future defaulted payments
and has reduced revenue and accounts receivable by that amount.

For an additional charge, the Company offers customers  ancillary services which
are  not  required  to be  purchased  with a  product.  These  services  include
additional  technical  support and/or  specific  product  services.  The Company
recognizes  revenue when the service is completed;  receipts for services  which
have not been completed are included in deferred revenue.

NET INCOME OR LOSS PER SHARE

The Company  computes  net income or loss per share in  accordance  with ASC 260
"Earnings  per  Share."  Under ASC 260,  basic  net  income or loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss per share available to common  stockholders by the
weighted  average number of shares  outstanding  for the period and excludes the
effects of any  potentially  dilutive  securities.  Diluted  earnings per share,
includes the dilution  that would occur upon the exercise or  conversion  of all
potentially  dilutive  securities  into common stock using the "treasury  stock"
and/or "if converted"  methods as applicable.  In computing diluted earnings per
share for the six month period ended December 31, 2013, the Company has included
as  outstanding  1,000,000  options which are  exercisable  and have an exercise
price below the average market price for the Company's shares during the period.
For all  other  periods  presented,  potentially  dilutive  securities  would be
anti-dilutive have not been included in computing diluted earnings per share.

              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                DECEMBER 31, 2014
                                   (UNAUDITED)



NOTE 2.  GOING CONCERN
----------------------

The  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  using
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
applicable  for a going  concern which assumes that the Company will realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary  course of business.  As of
December 31, 2014, the Company had a working  capital  deficit of  approximately
$1,688,000 and had  accumulated  losses of  approximately  $3,271,000  since its
inception.  The  Company's  ability to continue as a going  concern is dependent
upon its ability to obtain the  necessary  financing or to earn profits from its
business operations to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from
normal  business  operations  when  they come due.  In the past few  years,  the
Company  switched its focus to  developing  its own products.  In May 2012,  the
Company launched MagCast which the Company expects to be an integral part of its
businesses on an ongoing basis.  MagCast is being sold directly to customers and
through an affiliate network which expands the Company's selling  capability and
has a broad target  market beyond the Company's  traditional  customer  base. In
April of 2014,  the Company  began  offering the Ultimate  Product  System which
incorporates 30DC's digital marketing platform Market Pro Max. Until the Company
achieves sustained profitability it does not have sufficient capital to meet its
needs and continues to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs.

No  commitments to provide  additional  funds have been made and there can be no
assurance that any additional  funds will be available to cover expenses as they
may be  incurred.  If the  Company  is unable  to raise  additional  capital  or
encounters  unforeseen  circumstances,  it may be  required  to take  additional
measures to conserve  liquidity,  which could  include,  but not  necessarily be
limited  to,  issuance of  additional  shares of the  Company's  stock to settle
operating liabilities which would dilute existing  shareholders,  curtailing its
operations, suspending the pursuit of its business plan and controlling overhead
expenses.  The Company  cannot  provide any assurance that new financing will be
available to it on commercially  acceptable  terms, if at all. These  conditions
raise  substantial  doubt  about the  Company's  ability to  continue as a going
concern.  These condensed  consolidated  financial statements do not include any
adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

For the past few years,  the  Company  offered  MagCast  through a once per year
large-scale  promotion  for which the majority of sales were  through  marketing
affiliates  which  are  unrelated  parties  who earn  commissions  by  referring
customers  to the  Company  and a majority of the  Company's  annual  sales were
during the promotion.  The Company held a smaller  promotion  through  marketing
affiliates in July 2014 than in prior years. The Company does not expect to have
a large-scale promotion during this fiscal year.

NOTE 3. DIVESTITURE
-------------------

Effective  February 28, 2014, the Company  divested assets and liabilities  that
made up its Immediate Edge subscription business ("Edge") to Raine Ventures, LLC
("Raine")  in exchange for the  10,560,000  common  shares of the Company  which

and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill of  approximately  $225,000.  Raine
assumed  liability for deferred  revenue of approximately  $19,000.  The Company

months  ended  December  31,  2013  (see  note 4).  Raine  had  been  party to a
contractor agreement with the Company which had expired in 2012 and was extended
on a month to month basis and was terminated concurrent with the divestiture.

NOTE 4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
-------------------------------

The  Company  has  included  two  businesses  in  discontinued  operations;  the
Immediate Edge business which was divested effective February 28, 2014 (see note
3) and the business of Infinity which was discontinued  after the share exchange
with  30DC DE on  September  10,  2010.  Prior to the share  exchange,  Infinity
withdrew its election to operate as a Business Development Company ("BDC") under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act").  Infinity historically operated
as a non-diversified,  closed-end management investment company and prepared its
financial  statements  as required by the 1940 Act.  30DC is no longer  actively
operating  the BDC and the  assets,  liabilities  and results of  operations  of
Infinity's former business are shown as discontinued operations in the Company's
financial  statements  subsequent to the share  exchange  with 30DC.  Investment
companies  report  assets at fair value and the Company has  continued to report
investment assets in discontinued operations on this basis.

CORPORATE HISTORY

On September 10, 2010,  Infinity  Capital Group,  Inc., a Maryland  Corporation,
("Infinity")   entered  into  a  Plan  and  Agreement  of  Reorganization   (the
"Agreement")  with 30DC,  Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation,  ("30DC  DE") and the
Shareholders of 30DC DE ("30DC DE  Shareholders.").  In exchange for 100% of the
issued and outstanding  shares of 30DC DE, Infinity issued  60,984,000 shares of

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

its restricted  common stock.  The 30DC DE Shareholders  received 13.2 shares of
common stock of Infinity for every one share of 30DC DE.  Infinity,  as a result
of the transaction,  became the owning entity of 100% of the outstanding  shares
of common stock of 30DC DE. For purposes of  accounting,  30DC DE was considered
the accounting acquirer.  The business of 30DC DE became the primary business of
Infinity.  Infinity was renamed 30DC, Inc.  (Maryland) ("30DC" and together with
its subsidiary "the Company").  30DC DE was  incorporated on October 17, 2008 in
the state of  Delaware,  as a holding  company,  for the  purpose  of  building,
acquiring and managing international web-based sales and marketing companies. On
July 15, 2009, 30DC DE completed the  acquisitions of the business and assets of
30 Day Challenge ("30 Day") and Immediate Edge ("Immediate").

In May of 2012 the Company  signed a joint venture  agreement  ("JV  Agreement")
with Netbloo Media,  Ltd.  ("Netbloo") for the joint  development of the MagCast
Digital Publishing Platform ("MagCast").  MagCast provides customers access to a
cloud-based  service  to  create an  application  ("App")  to  publish a digital
magazine on the digital  distribution  platforms Apple Newsstand and Google Play
and  includes  executive  training  modules  to  develop  and  market a  digital
magazine.  MagCast  was  launched  in May 2012 and a majority  of sales were the
result of affiliate marketing relationships which result in commission of 50% of
gross  revenue for those sales to the  affiliate  responsible  for the sale.  In
October 2012 the Company reached an agreement to purchase Netbloo's 50% interest
in the MagCast JV Agreement and Market Pro Max an online marketing platform that
allows  anyone  to create  digital  products  and  quickly  build a  variety  of
ecommerce  marketing  websites for a purchase price of 13,487,363  shares of the
Company's common stock.

Effective  February 28, 2014, the Company  divested assets and liabilities  that
made up to Raine Ventures,  LLC ("Raine") in exchange for the 10,560,000  common
shares  of the  Company  which  Raine had held.  Please  see Note 3 for  further
details on the divestiture.

30DC was  founded in 2005 by  offering  a free  Internet  marketing  educational
program that was  originally  known as The 30 Day Challenge and has evolved into
the  Company's  current  Challenge  program.   The  Challenge  is  a  thirty-day
interactive  educational  program  configured to give participants the framework
and guidance to design and develop an on-line  business.  The course  content is
made  available by  subscription  throughout the year as the Ignition Blue Print
training course.

The  Challenge  program  includes  modules  on  a  range  of  topics,  including
researching market opportunity and competition, identifying and sustaining niche
markets,  utilizing  social  media to build  your  business,  among  many  other
subjects pertinent to Internet  marketing.  There are no prerequisites to taking
the course and  participants  come from around the globe.  The course content of
The Challenge is geared to individuals,  professionals  and business people with
an interest in Internet marketing.  The participants might be motivated to begin
a new on-line  business  or extend  existing  `brick-and-mortar'  business to an
on-line  platform.  Increasingly,  Challenge  participants  are  involved in the
migration of business to the mobile  media  comprised  of tablet  computers  and
smartphones.

The  Challenge has  predominately  grown  through our viral  marketing  campaign
whereby  participants  are encouraged to publicize the program through email and
social  media,  including  Twitter,  Facebook,  FriendFeed  and blogs focused on

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Internet  marketing.  The growth in The  Challenge  community  has resulted in a
targeted community, to which the Company markets other high-valued added digital
media training courses and solutions as well as third-party  products related to
Internet marketing.

The Company's  first  digital media  solution,  The MagCast  Digital  Publishing
Platform  ("MagCast")  originated  from the  collaboration  of 30DC with Netbloo
Media Ltd.  ("Netbloo')  in a joint venture.  It was first  introduced in fiscal
year 2012, as a  software-as-a-service  for publication of digital magazines and
other  proprietary  content to mobile  devices  through mobile  applications  or
`apps'  based on the Applie iOS and Google  Android  architectures.  The MagCast
platform is  relevant  to the  Company's  historical  customer  base of Internet
marketers  as well as a broader  audience of users  interested  in  marketing to
their clients  through the mobile  medium.  Publications  created on the MagCast
platform can be distributed to readers  through Apple  Newsstand or Google Play,
the app  distribution  channels for the two principal  mobile  device  operating
systems. We believe the MagCast platform is distinctive among digital publishing
applications by providing users with a built-in suite of marketing functions and
tools.  We believe we are the first to introduce such a product and expect these
features to differentiate the MagCast platform from competitors.

The Company has continued to update the MagCast software  application to improve
functionality  and 30DC has engaged a dedicated  team of software  developers to
create new product  features.  Initially  mobile apps created  using the MagCast
platform were available  only to readers with Apple iPad devices.  In the summer
2013,  the Company  released  MagCast  version 4, which enabled our customers to
offer  a  version  of  their   publication   tailored  for  the  iPhone  thereby
significantly  expanding  the  potential  number of  magazine  readers.  MagCast
version 6 released in July 2014 enabled  distribution  through Google Play where
their  digital  magazine is available to users of Android  devices.  This update
included a variety  of new  features  and  capabilities  such as dynamic  in-app
purchasing,  a survey funnel, e-mail sharing,  push notifications,  and Facebook
event  tracking,  among other modern  marketing  techniques  that could  benefit
MagCast  platform users. In September 2014,  MagCast version 7 was released with
an in-app sales funnel and the user  interface was improved to  facilitate  list
building  and  issuance  of new  products  and  service  offers.  Version  7 was
optimized for both  Google's  Android  architecture  and Apple's iOS 8 operating
system, which are the two most popular mobile device architectures.

Digital Publishing  Blueprint is a comprehensive  training program that provides
instruction  in developing  and marketing a digital  publication.  The course is
designed  to  instruct  participants  in  content  monetization  and  the use of
proprietary  content to create  brand  awareness  and build  sales.  The fee for
Digital  Publishing  Blueprint  includes  a  license  for the  MagCast  Digitial
Publishing Platform.

Market Pro Max is on-line  marketing system acquired in 2012 from Netbloo Media,
Ltd. Market Pro Max is made available to users as a  software-as-a-service.  The
application provides plug-n-play functionality to create on-line marketing sites
with little or no programming experience.  Market Pro Max is targeted at digital
businesses and information publishers seeking to monetize content on-line.

Starting in 2014,  Market Pro Max has been sold in  conjunction  with an on-line
training  course  Ultimate  Product System.  This  video-based  course helps the
novice  e-marketer  identify and define a market niche and package  products for
greatest marketability.

BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

We generate revenue through subscriptions to on-line training programs, the sale
of  video-based  training  courses,  and the sale of licenses for the use of our
proprietary digital publishing  solutions.  We also earn commissions on the sale
of  third-party  Internet  marketing  products and services to the 30DC customer
base and in particular  during and after the annual Challenge  training program.
Such revenue is referred to as affiliate marketing commissions.

The Company's long-term growth strategy is to increase its portfolio of products
and services while expanding the audience to which it markets those products and
services.  Our  business  has  historically  been  driven by the  attraction  of
participants  to a no-fee Internet  marketing  program,  The Challenge,  and the

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

retention  of  those   participants  as  potential   customers  for  other  high
valued-added training programs and digital publishing solutions.  Nearly 200,000
individuals have participated in The Challenge since its inception.

To expand the Company's  access to potential  customers,  during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2012, 30DC began a more comprehensive  program of selling through
affiliate marketing  relationships.  Affiliates promote 30DC's products to their
respective  customer bases and receive a commission from 30DC as a percentage of
gross revenue typically in a range of 30% to 50%.

In fiscal year 2013, the Company  initiated its MagCast  Certified  Professional
(MCP) program for the resale of the MagCast Digital Publishing Platform. The MCP
program is intended to drive penetration of corporate and other vertical markets
with an interest in reaching  their  audiences  with  digital  content on mobile
devices.

30DC's marketing  strategy includes  paid-for traffic  generation to its product
web sites as well as the purchase of sales leads for product  promotion  through
targeted e-mails. Additionally,  during fiscal year 2014, the Company began test
marketing on-line and mobile  advertising,  which has become more  sophisticated
and enables  targeting of customers who are more likely to be interested in 30DC
products and services.  The initial  advertising  test focused on the Market Pro
Max system and related training program Ultimate Product System.

The Company  has no plans at this time for  purchases  or sales of fixed  assets
which would occur in the next twelve months.

The Company has no expectation or anticipation of significant  changes in number
of employees in the next twelve months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2014  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTH
PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

During the three months ended December 31, 2014, 30DC, Inc.  recognized revenues
of $176,722 from  continuing  operations  compared to $207,746  during the three
months ended December 31, 2013.  Revenues from  continuing  operations were from
the following  sources  during the three months ended December 31, 2014 compared
to December 31, 2013.

   Total Revenues         $        176,722   $       207,746    $       (31,024)

The $31,684  increase  in  subscription  revenue  was due to a new online  forum
subscription  product  which  was  launched  in April  2014 and has a  recurring
monthly charge.

The $64,944  decrease in products and services revenue resulted from a number of
offsetting  factors.  Revenue from the MagCast Publishing  Platform decreased by
$141,717 primarily due to a special promotion for existing customers to purchase
an additional  license in October 2013 which did not repeat in the 2014 quarter.
This was  partially  offset by a  $10,725  increase  in sales of Market  Pro Max
including the Ultimate  Product System which is a training program that includes
a lifetime  license for one Market Pro Max marketing web site and an increase in
sales of $66,113 in the sale of other  products  the  company has  developed  on
topics such as increasing traffic to web sites.

                              ================== ================== ============

The decrease of $35,600 in  accounting  fees was due to a decrease of $41,600 in
charges from the Company's  independent auditing firm which was primarily due to
a delay in timing of the  Company's  audit for the fiscal  year  ending June 30,
2013 which resulted in charges being delayed beyond September 30, 2013 offset by
$6,000 paid to an  e-commerce  accounting  firm which was  engaged  July 2014 to
automate and administer recording and reconciling 30DC's daily transactions.

The increase of $22,526 in  advertising  is due to the Company  advertising  its
digital  products on Facebook  and the cost of marketing  consultant  who helped
with the advertising campaign.

The decrease of $30,398 in  commissions  resulted from the $141,717  decrease in
revenue  from the  MagCast  Publishing  Platform,  a portion  of which are sales
marketing  affiliate  relationships  which result in  commission  expense and an
under  accrual of in the  September  2013 quarter of  approximately  $15,000 for
commissions  related to the  promotional  launch in August 2013 which  increased
commissions in the December 2013 quarter.

The  decrease of $57,734 in  independent  contractors  is  primarily  due to the
Company terminating its relationship with two long-term contractors,  one at the
end of July 2014, saving the Company  approximately $9,000 per month, and one at
the end of August 2014,  saving the Company  approximately  $6,000 per month. In
addition the  December  2013 quarter  included  approximately  $12,000 paid to a
contractor hired to help with the Company's  annual free course,  the Challenge,
$6,500 paid to investor relations consultants, $5,000 for a strategic consultant
and $3,000 for a valuation  analyst.  These increases were offset by an increase
of $6,000 per month to a contractor who has assumed additional responsibilities.

The decrease of $7,954 in directors'  fees is from a reduction in the charge for
amortization of stock option expense over the vesting period,  for stock options
previously issued to Henry Pinskier,  the Company's board chair, in the December
2014 quarter from the amount in the December  2013 quarter due to fewer  options
remaining unvested.

The  decrease  of $24,954 in  officer's  salaries  was due to a  reduction  in a
reduction  in base salary for  Theodore A.  Greenberg,  the  Company's  CFO from
$200,000 to $132,000 per year and a reduction in the charge for  amortization of
stock  option  expense over the vesting  period,  for stock  options  previously
issued to Mr.  Greenberg  in the  December  2014  quarter from the amount in the
December 2013 quarter due to fewer options remaining unvested.

The decrease of $8,368 in Related Party  Contractors  was due to a change in the
exchange  rate  which  reduced  the US  Dollar  amount  for  Marillion  Partners
contractor fees which are paid in Australian Dollars.

Travel and  Entertainment  decreased  by  $43,457  due to a  company-wide  group
meeting and travel to an investor  conference,  both in November  2013 which did
not repeat in the December 2014 quarter.

During the three months ended  December 31, 2014,  the Company  recognized a net
loss  from  continuing  operations  of  $235,898  compared  to a net  loss  from
continuing  operations  of $399,318  during the three months ended  December 31,
2013. The reduced net loss from continuing operations of $163,420 was due to the
decrease in  operating  expenses of $200,704  offset by a decrease in revenue of
$31,024 and forgiveness of debt income of $6,260 in the December 2013 quarter.

FOR THE SIX MONTH  PERIOD  ENDED  DECEMBER  31,  2014  COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTH
PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

During the six months ended December 31, 2014, 30DC, Inc. recognized revenues of
$876,789 from continuing operations compared to $2,150,625 during the six months
ended  December 31, 2013.  Revenues  from  continuing  operations  were from the
following  sources  during the six months ended  December  31, 2014  compared to
December 31, 2013.

   Total Revenues         $      876,789     $     2,150,625   $   $ (1,273,836)

The $61,638  increase  in  subscription  revenue  was due to a new online  forum
subscription  product  which  was  launched  in April  2014 and has a  recurring
monthly charge.

The  $1,332,671  decrease in products and  services  revenue was mainly due to a
decrease of $1,430,830  in revenue from the MagCast  Publishing  Platform  which
resulted from a smaller launch promotion in July 2014 than August 2013. This was
partially  offset by a $30,689 increase in sales of Market Pro Max including the
Ultimate  Product  System which is a training  program that  includes a lifetime
license  for one Market Pro Max  marketing  web site and an increase in sales of
$67,535 in the sale of other  products the company has  developed on topics such
as increasing traffic to web sites.

During the six months ended December 31, 2014, the Company  incurred  $1,050,701
in operational expenses for continuing  operations compared to $1,898,606 during
the six months  ended  December 31, 2013.  Operational  expenses  during the six
months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, include the following categories:

                              ================= ================= ==============

The increase of $33,720 in  advertising  is due to the Company  advertising  its
digital  products on Facebook  and the cost of marketing  consultant  who helped
with the advertising campaign.

The  decrease  of $77,074  in credit  card  processing  fees  resulted  from the
$1,273,836  decrease  in revenue  and a decrease  of  approximately  1.5% in the
effective credit card processing rate.

The decrease of $605,008 in commissions resulted from the $1,332,671 decrease in
products  and  services  revenue,  a  significant  portion  of which  are  sales
marketing affiliate relationships which result in commission expense.

The  decrease of $69,526 in  independent  contractors  is  primarily  due to the
Company terminating its relationship with two long-term contractors,  one at the
end of July 2014, saving the Company  approximately $9,000 per month, and one at
the end of August 2014,  saving the Company  approximately  $6,000 per month. In
addition the six months ended December 2013 included  approximately $12,000 paid
to a  contractor  hired to help  with the  Company's  annual  free  course,  the
Challenge, $6,500 paid to investor relations consultants, $5,000 for a strategic
consultant and $3,000 for a valuation analyst. These increases were offset by an
increase  of  $6,000  per  month  to a  contractor  who has  assumed  additional
responsibilities.

The decrease of $15,909 in directors' fees is from a reduction in the charge for
amortization of stock option expense over the vesting period,  for stock options
previously  issued to Henry  Pinskier,  the  Company's  board chair,  in the six
months ended December 2014 from the amount in the six months ended December 2013
due to fewer options remaining unvested.

The  decrease  of $49,909 in  officer's  salaries  was due to a  reduction  in a
reduction  in base salary for  Theodore A.  Greenberg,  the  Company's  CFO from
$200,000 to $132,000 per year and a reduction in the charge for  amortization of
stock  option  expense over the vesting  period,  for stock  options  previously
issued to Mr. Greenberg in the six months ended December 2014 from the amount in
the six months ended December 2013 due to fewer options remaining unvested.

Travel and  Entertainment  decreased  by  $43,035  due to a  company-wide  group
meeting and travel to an investor  conference,  both in November  2013 which did
not repeat during the six months ended December 2014.

During the six months ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized a net loss
from  continuing  operations of $173,912  compared to net income from continuing
operations  of $345,532  during the six months  ended  December  31,  2013.  The
decrease in net income from  continuing  operations  of $519,444  was due to the
decrease in revenue  $1,273,836  offset by the  decrease in  operating  expenses
$847,905  and  forgiveness  of debt  income of $93,513  in the six months  ended
December 2013.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company had a cash  balance of $123,102 at December 31, 2014 and the Company
had a working  capital  deficit of $1,688,377.  To fund working  capital for the
next 12 months,  the Company expects to raise capital and to improve the results
of operations from increasing revenue as well as a reduction in operating costs.
The Company expects increased  revenue from further sales of MagCast  Publishing
Platform  through  its  Digital  Publishing  Blueprint  training  course  and by
marketing to customers  outside its  historical  customer  base with the goal of
recurring  revenue through annual licenses.  The Company also expects  increased
revenue from further sales of Market Pro Max through its Ultimate Product System
training  course  and  introduction  of new  products  some  of  which  will  be
extensions  of existing  product  lines.  Additionally,  the Company  intends to
increase funds available by raising capital, though at this time the Company has
not commenced any offerings and cannot guarantee that they will be successful in
its capital raising efforts. If the results of operations and capital raised, if
any, are not  sufficient  to fund the  Company's  expenses as they come due, the
Company  will defer  amounts due to related  parties and to the extent  possible
utilize shares of the Company to satisfy its liabilities.

Included in  liabilities  of  discontinued  operations  at December  31, 2014 is
$53,550 in notes payable plus related  accrued  interest that are in default for
lack of repayment by their due date.

During the six month  period  ended  December  31,  2014,  operating  activities
provided the Company with  $33,376.  During the six month period ended  December
31, 2013, operating activities provided the Company with $117,173.  The decrease
of $83,797 in funds  provided by operating  activities  was a combination of the
decrease in net income from continuing  operations of approximately  $517,559, a
decrease of approximately $317,000 in the change in accrued expenses and refunds
due to payment of commissions  which accrued on accounts  receivable at June 30,
2013 and change in status of  accrued  contractor  fees in the six months  ended
December  31,  2013 from due to related  parties  because  Clinton  Carey was no
longer a member of the  Company's  board and a decrease in  deferred  revenue of
approximately  $82,000.  This was  offset by a  decrease  in change in  accounts
receivable of approximately $200,000 due to accounts receivable from the MagCast
relaunch in August 2013, an increase of approximately  $116,000 in the change in
accounts  payable due to  affiliate  commissions  which were due at December 31,
2014 from the MagCast  relaunch in July 2014 and payment of accounts payable due
June 30, 2013 with shares of the Company  during the six months  ended  December
31,  2013, a decrease to the change in due to related  parties of  approximately
$340,000 because Clinton Carey was no longer a member of the Company's board, an
approximate  decrease  of $133,000  to change in the amount of  restricted  cash
which is the amount held in reserve by the Company's credit card processor which
was higher at December 31, 2013 due to the MagCast relaunch in August 2013 and a
decrease  of  approximately  $93,000 in  forgiveness  of debt  income  which was
including  in net income  from  continuing  operations  in the six months  ended
December 2014 but did not generate cash.

GOING CONCERN

The  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  using
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
applicable  for a going  concern which assumes that the Company will realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary  course of business.  As of
December 31, 2014, the Company has a working  capital  deficit of  approximately
$1,688,000 and has  accumulated  losses of  approximately  $3,271,000  since its
inception.  The  Company's  ability to continue as a going  concern is dependent
upon the ability of the  Company to obtain the  necessary  financing  or to earn
profits  from  its  business  operations  to meet  its  obligations  and pay its
liabilities  arising from normal business  operations when they come due. In the
past few years,  the Company  switched its focus to developing its own products.

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

In May 2012,  the Company  launched  MagCast which the Company  expects to be an
integral  part of its  businesses  on an  ongoing  basis.  MagCast is being sold
directly  to  customers  and  through an  affiliate  network  which  expands the
Company's selling  capability and has a broad target market beyond the Company's
traditional  customer  base. In April of 2014,  the Company  began  offering the
Ultimate Product System which  incorporates  30DC's digital  marketing  platform
Market Pro Max. Until the Company achieves  sustained  profitability it does not
have sufficient  capital to meet its needs and continues to seek loans or equity
placements to cover such cash needs.

No  commitments to provide  additional  funds have been made and there can be no
assurance that any additional  funds will be available to cover expenses as they
may be  incurred.  If the  Company  is unable  to raise  additional  capital  or
encounters  unforeseen  circumstances,  it may be  required  to take  additional
measures to conserve  liquidity,  which could  include,  but not  necessarily be
limited  to,  issuance of  additional  shares of the  Company's  stock to settle
operating liabilities which would dilute existing  shareholders,  curtailing its
operations, suspending the pursuit of its business plan and controlling overhead
expenses.  The Company  cannot  provide any assurance that new financing will be
available to it on commercially  acceptable  terms, if at all. These  conditions
raise  substantial  doubt  about the  Company's  ability to  continue as a going
concern.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company earns the majority of its revenue in United States  dollars  ("USD")
and pays a  significant  amount of its expense in  Australian  dollars  ("AUD").
Material fluctuations in the exchange rate between USD and AUD may have material
impact on the Company's results of operations.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
--------------------------------

DISCLOSURES CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e)  under the  Securities  Exchange Act of
1934,  as  amended  (the  "Exchange  Act"))  that are  designed  to ensure  that
information  required to be disclosed in our reports  under the Exchange Act, is
recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods  required
under  the  SEC's  rules and forms  and that the  information  is  gathered  and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by SEC Rule  15d-15(b) for the quarter ended  December 31, 2014, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  Officer,  carried out an evaluation
under the  supervision  and with the  participation  of our  management,  of the
effectiveness  of the  design  and  operation  of our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures  pursuant  to  Exchange  Act Rule  15d-14 as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on the foregoing  evaluation,  they have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting
them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings
and to ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed  in our  periodic SEC
filings is accumulated and  communicated to our management,  including our Chief
Executive Officer,  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a
result of the  deficiency  in our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting
discussed below.

MANAGEMENT'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

With the  participation  of our Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chief  Accounting
Officer,  we have  evaluated the  effectiveness  of our  "internal  control over
financial  reporting" (as such term is defined in Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " Exchange Act ")),
as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon such evaluation,
our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as
of the end of such period,  our "internal  control over financial  reporting" is
not effective due to the material  weaknesses  noted below, in ensuring that (i)
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

under the Exchange Act is recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is  accumulated  and  communicated  to our
management,  including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

(1)  Segregation of Duties: We do not currently have a sufficient  complement of
     technical  accounting  and  external  reporting  personal  commensurate  to
     support standalone external financial reporting under public company or SEC
     requirements.  Specifically,  the  Company  did not  effectively  segregate
     certain  accounting  duties due to the small size of its accounting  staff,
     and maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel  necessary
     to anticipate and identify  risks  critical to financial  reporting and the
     closing process.  In addition,  there were inadequate reviews and approvals
     by the Company's  personnel of certain  reconciliations and other processes
     in day-to-day operations due to the lack of a full complement of accounting
     staff.

(2)  Financial  Reporting  Systems:  We did  not  maintain  a  fully  integrated
     financial consolidation and reporting system throughout the period and as a
     result,  extensive  manual  analysis,  reconciliation  and adjustments were
     required in order to produce  financial  statements for external  reporting
     purposes.

REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESS

As our current  financial  condition  allows, we are in the process of analyzing
and  developing  our  processes  for the  establishment  of formal  policies and
procedures with necessary segregation of duties, which will establish mitigating
controls to compensate  for the risk due to lack of  segregation  of duties.  In
July 2014, the Company  contracted an e-commerce  accounting  firm to automate a
number  of our  accounting  processes  and  to  provide  outsourced  bookkeeping
services that provide for segregation of some of the duties which previously had
not been.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

There  was no change in our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that
occurred  during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, that has materially
affected,  or is reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  our internal control
over financial reporting.
